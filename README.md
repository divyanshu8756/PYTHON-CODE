PROJECT DETAILS 
 
This project is a Python library consolidating 34 distinct mathematical and number theory functions, developed as a structured assignment. 

It covers a broad spectrum of concepts, ranging from fundamental properties like factorial, palindrome checks, and digital roots, to advanced topics in modular arithmetic, primality testing, and classic sequences. Designed for clarity, efficiency, and educational value, this repository serves as a robust reference for number theory algorithms, complete with implementations for finding prime factors, checking perfect powers, and analyzing number types like amicable and highly composite numbers.

It is useful for introductory programming exercises, basic data validation, algorithmic efficiency, cryptography, advanced data structure exercises, calculus and advanced mathematics.
